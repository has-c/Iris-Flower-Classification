# Iris Flower Classification
Iris Flower Classifier uses the Python3 sci-kit packages for supervised machine learning. Model was trained to distinguish between types of Iris Flowers (setosa, versicolor and virginca). 

## Results:

It was observed that on average Logisitic Regression classified a greater proportion of the Iris flowers correctly when compared to KNN 
or Decision Trees.
